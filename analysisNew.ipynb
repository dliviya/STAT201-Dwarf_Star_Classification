    "Stars are typically classified into four different groups – white dwarfs, main sequence, giants, and supergiants (Chiosi, 1992). A typical star will become a main sequence star, then end its life cycle as a white dwarf. This is the most frequent lifecycle that we see (Tillman, 2022). White dwarfs are very small dense stars that are not very bright when compared to main-sequence stars (Koester, 1990). Contrary to their name, the red dwarfs are not a type of white dwarf but rather a type of small main-sequence star that is not very bright. Similarly, we have brown dwarfs, which are not usually classified as stars because they do not burn hot enough. (Tillman, 2019) When a massive star is formed, it will become a giant star or a supergiant and then end its lifecycle as a neutron star or a blackhole. Giants and supergiants are enormous stars that shine very bright when compared to main-sequence stars (Chiosi, 1992). \n",
    "\n",
    "While white, red, and brown dwarf stars share a name, they are very different and typically not classified together. This is clearly seen in an Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (a scatter plot that shows the trends in star types against luminosity, temperature, color, and magnitude) where white dwarfs have their own classification in the bottom left, and red and white dwarfs are grouped together in the main sequence group towards the bottom right. Since all three stars appear on the bottom half of the diagram we want to explore the difference in luminosity and temperature between the three.\n",

    "## Analysis Question\n",
    "In this project, we want to determine if there is a difference in luminosity and temperature between red, brown, and white dwarf stars. Our location parameter will be the mean of luminosity and temperature and our scale parameter will be the standard deviation of both luminosity and temperature. We chose these because we have a large dataset (240 observations) and thus the CLT takes effect, and we can treat the dataset as normally distributed.\n",

The plots would be a better representation if we were to do some further data processing like bootstrapping or asymptotic testing.

    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a test to determine whether the difference between means across three or more groups exist by analyzing the overall and within-group variance. ANOVA test calculates F-value, which is the ratio of the variability between group means and the variation within groups, and corresponding p-value. If F-value is significantly greater than 1, the p-value is going to be small, we conclude that the variability between group means exists. In this project, since our goal is to analyze the difference between temperature and luminosity of three groups of dwarf planets, ANOVA becomes very appropriate and effective.

    "## Implication of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of our ANOVA test indicate that there do exist differences between the three types of dwarfs in terms of temperature and luminosity. We are now relatively confident that the three types of dwarfs do not have the same average temperature and luminosity. \n",
    "First of all, we believe this finding further clarifies the difference between dwarf stars, giving a better understanding of stars and celestial bodies in the universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the article Red dwarfs: The most common and longest-lived stars, the author states that there is no true definition of red dwarf; the classification just refers to dwarf stars with different spectral types (Tillman, 2019). Therefore, we hope our finding helps to improve the accuracy of the star classification system. We also believe that the results could be easily applied to the real-world situation when people are doing actual astronomical analysis. For example, if anyone tries to clarify between multiple groups of dwarf stars, the results of this project could help them make a meaningful guess based on temperature and luminosity data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the difference in temperature and luminosity could indicate the existence of other differences which have not yet been found by people. It leads to various research topics on the reasons that cause these differences and impact of these differences on our current knowledge of celestial bodies."

    "## Limitations of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several limitations of our analysis. The first limitation is that although using ANOVA would be far better at limiting the probability of type 1 error, our groups do not have roughly equal variances. The temperature of white stars has a variance of $4957.6552^2$ which far exceeds that of the other 2 groups. A similar phenomenon is observed in the luminosity of brown stars, which is far less than the other 2 types. Therefore, our F-scores for both variables are somewhat inflated. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second limitation is that although our dataset is large enough (240 observations), our within-group distributions for the luminosity of white/brown/red stars are right skewed. Therefore, we might need a larger sample for the CLT to take effect for luminosity.\n"
