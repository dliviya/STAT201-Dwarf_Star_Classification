A typical star will become a main sequence star and then end its lifecycle as a white dwarf, these are the most common stars (“Main Sequence Stars: Definition & Life Cycle.” ). Red dwarfs are not a type of white dwarf, rather they are a type of small main sequence star that is not very bright. Another type of dwarf is a brown dwarf. These are not usually classified as stars because they do not burn hot enough (“Red Dwarfs: The Most Common and Longest-Lived Stars.”). White dwarfs are very small dense stars that are not very bright when compared to main sequence stars (Koester). When a massive star is formed it will become a giant star or a supergiant and then end its lifecycle as a neutron star or a blackhole. Giants and supergiants are very large stars (with supergiant being even larger) that shine very bright when compared to main sequence stars (Chiosi). \n",

    "This report is trustworthy because the dataset that we use is fairly large, so it is potentially of the true population. Therefore the mean estimates that we have calculated can be good starting points to create confidence intervals for our population parameters. While our estimations are a good starting point, they are not enough to present to a stakeholder. The plots would be a better representation if we were to do some further data processing like bootstrapping or asymptotic testing. Additionally there is no way to estimate the sampling variability of the population of stars by examining point estimates of the standard deviation, or the distribution of values of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address the gap we brought up above, we need to bootstrap to more closely approximate the actual distribution of the population, and by extension find a range of possible parameter estimates as opposed to a point estimate.\n",
    "In the final report, we expect to find whether we are confident to say there is a difference in the luminosity and temperature between dwarf stars. We will express our result and the uncertainty in a trustworthy way. We believe finding this clarifies the difference in some features between different types of dwarf stars, and further increases the accuracy and reliability of star classification. This analysis leads to future questions such as “is there a difference in the magnitude between dwarf stars”. Additionally we can use these results to infer real astronomical observations.\n",

    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a test to determine whether the difference between means across three or more groups exist by analyzing the overall and within-group variance. ANOVA test calculates F-value, which is the ratio of the variability between group means and the variation within groups, and corresponding p-value. If F-value is significantly greater than 1, the p-value is going to be small, we conclude that the variability between group means exists. In this project, since our goal is to analyze the difference between temperature and luminosity of three groups of dwarf planets, ANOVA becomes very appropriate and effective. In this section, we will conduct two ANOVA tests across three dwarf groups on both variables, and analyze the results.\n"

The p-value also states the result. Since p-value is significantly smaller than the critical value (0.05), it falls in reject region.
